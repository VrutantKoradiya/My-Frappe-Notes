A Custom DocType exists only in your DB (unless you export it into an app).


Example: School Management App
Suppose you installed an app called School Management.

This app comes with standard DocTypes like:


-Student


-Teacher


-Course


These are standard DocTypes — they live in the app’s code. Anyone installing the app will get them.


Now you create a Custom DocType
Let’s say, in your system you want to track School Buses 🚍.
You go to Desk > Developer > DocType > New, and you create a DocType called School Bus.


-This School Bus DocType is only in your database, not in the app’s code.


-If another person installs the School Management app on their own site, they won’t have your School Bus DocType.


-It lives only in your current site’s DB, because you made it as a Custom DocType.
