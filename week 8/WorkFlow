WorkFlow :::::::::::

- A Workflow is used to control the approval process or status transition of a document (DocType).
- It defines who can change a document from one state to another (like Draft → Approved → Rejected).



⚙️ Real-world Example

Let’s say you have a Leave Application doctype.

You want this flow:
Draft → Pending Approval → Approved / Rejected


🔹 Result
Now, users will see workflow action buttons like “Submit for Approval”, “Approve”, or “Reject” depending on their role.


so, 
Workflow = a defined set of states + allowed transitions + who can perform them.
or
Workflow = States + Actions + Transitions + Roles.


How to create : 
1. Search WorkFLow List -> New - > Fille fields like name & doctype name
2. now you can add different states for the doctype
3. now you can add different Action/Transition Rules for the Doctype.
