Script Reports questions ...... 

1.  why we write _ like {"label": _("First Name"), "fieldname": "first_name", "fieldtype": "Data", "width": 150}, ? 
-> _ is a function, not a variable or wildcard import. Its main purpose is translation.

like : from frappe import _  , {"label": _("First Name"), "fieldname": "first_name", "fieldtype": "Data", "width": 150}



How it works in your code:
"label" → This is the text that appears at the top of the column in your report.
_() → Tells Frappe: “This string can be translated into other languages if needed.”
"First Name" → The text shown by default (in English).




2. but in .js file it written like "label": __("Enable"), or in .py file  {"label": _("First Name"), "fieldname": "first_name", "fieldtype": "Data", "width": 150} , so my question 
   is why  in .js it is 2(__) and in .py it  is 1(_)

->  _() is a Python function imported from Frappe ,
    Purpose: mark the string for translation.
    Example: _('First Name') → If translations exist for other languages, Frappe will display them; otherwise, shows "First Name".
    In JavaScript (.js file) →  __() is the JS equivalent of _() in Python.  

It’s a global function in Frappe JS that handles translations.

Why different names?

Python and JS are different languages, so Frappe defines different functions for the same purpose.
Python: _()
JavaScript: __()

Functionality: exactly the same → mark strings for translation.


💡 So remember:
Python → single underscore _
JS → double underscore __
