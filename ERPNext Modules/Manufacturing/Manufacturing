✅ Doctypes Understanding



1. Bill of Materials (BOM) ----

🔹 Purpose / Role: 

- The Bill of Materials defines the recipe or blueprint for manufacturing a product.
- It lists which raw materials, in what quantity, and what operations are needed to make one finished item.
- It acts as the foundation for all manufacturing activities — like production planning, costing, and work orders.



🔹 Real-World Example (Laptop Manufacturing)
Let’s say your company manufactures Laptops.

To make 1 Laptop, you need: 1 Motherboard, 1 Screen, 1 Keyboard, 1 Battery, 1 Laptop Body


- In ERPNext, you create a Bill of Materials for the item Laptop.
- This BOM will define all these raw materials (and optionally operations like “Assemble Components”, “Install OS”, “Final Testing”).

- Later, when you create a Work Order, ERPNext will use this BOM to know what materials to consume and how many units to produce.

➡️ BOM = Recipe for making your Laptop.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. Production Plan


🔹 Purpose / Role :

- A Production Plan helps you organize and schedule manufacturing based on upcoming sales or material demands.
- It’s used when you need to produce multiple finished goods or plan production for a specific period — ensuring enough raw materials and capacity are available.

It basically answers the question: “What items should we manufacture, in what quantity, and when?”



🔹 Real-World Example (Laptop Manufacturing)

- Your company receives multiple sales orders for 100 Laptops next month.
- Instead of creating Work Orders one by one, you create a Production Plan for 100 Laptops.

ERPNext then:

- Automatically checks the Bill of Materials (BOM) of the Laptop.
- Calculates how many raw materials (like motherboards, screens, batteries, etc.) are required.
- Suggests creating Material Requests if stock is short.
- Generates Work Orders in bulk to manage production efficiently.



➡️ Production Plan = Big picture manufacturing schedule that ensures you have enough materials and resources to make your Laptops on time.




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



3. Work Order

🔹 Purpose / Role :

- A Work Order represents the actual production job — it’s a detailed instruction to manufacture a specific quantity of a finished item using a selected BOM.
- It tracks the entire process from starting production to consuming materials and creating the finished goods.

Think of it as the execution document in the manufacturing process.



🔹 Real-World Example (Laptop Manufacturing)

- After finalizing the Production Plan for 100 Laptops, you create a Work Order for, say, 50 Laptops first.



This Work Order:
- Refers to the Laptop BOM (recipe).
- Reserves required materials — like 50 motherboards, 50 screens, etc.
- Tells the shop floor team to start assembly.
- Tracks stages like Assembly, Quality Check, and Completion.
- Finally allows you to manufacture and update stock of 50 finished Laptops.


➡️ Work Order = The actual factory instruction that turns the BOM plan into real, physical Laptops.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. Operation

🔹 Purpose / Role

- An Operation defines a specific step or task in the manufacturing process — like assembling parts, testing, or packaging.
- Each operation represents a work activity that takes time, cost, and manpower, and can be assigned to a workstation.

It’s used inside the BOM and Work Orders to calculate time and cost more accurately.




🔹 Real-World Example (Laptop Manufacturing)

In your Laptop production process, there are several stages involved, such as:

1. Assemble Components – Fitting motherboard, battery, and screen into the laptop body.
2. Software Installation – Installing the operating system and required drivers.
3. Quality Testing – Checking display, keyboard, and performance.
4. Packaging – Boxing and labeling the final product.

Each of these stages is an Operation.

You’ll define them in ERPNext, so when a Work Order is created, ERPNext knows what steps to follow and can calculate total operation time and cost.



➡️ Operation = Step-by-step activity that transforms raw materials into the finished Laptop.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. Workstation Type

- A Workstation Type represents a category or class of workstations that perform similar kinds of operations.
- It helps standardize and organize your manufacturing setup — especially when you have multiple workstations doing the same type of job.

You can set default settings (like hourly rate, energy cost, capacity, etc.) at the Workstation Type level, and then individual workstations can inherit those properties.


🔹 Real-World Example (Laptop Manufacturing)
- In your Laptop factory, you might have multiple Assembly Tables or Testing Benches:

Workstation Type: Assembly Table → for assembling components.
Workstation Type: Testing Bench → for performing quality tests.
Workstation Type: Packaging Unit → for packing the finished Laptops.

So instead of defining rates and capacity for each individual workstation separately, you can define them once in Workstation Type and then assign that type to multiple workstations.




➡️ Workstation Type = Template or category used to group similar workstations in your Laptop production line.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. Workstation

🔹 Purpose / Role

- A Workstation represents the physical place or machine where a specific operation is performed in the manufacturing process.
- It helps track where the work happens, how much time and cost it takes, and what its capacity is.

Each workstation belongs to a Workstation Type and can be linked to multiple Operations in the BOM.




🔹 Real-World Example (Laptop Manufacturing)
- In your Laptop factory, you have multiple physical setups where operations take place:

Workstation 1: Assembly Table A → used for assembling laptop components
Workstation 2: Testing Bench 1 → used for performing hardware and software tests
Workstation 3: Packaging Unit 2 → used for final packing

When a Work Order is executed, ERPNext uses these workstations to:
- Allocate each Operation (like assembly or testing) to the right place
- Track how long each operation takes
- Calculate production cost based on workstation rate and time used



➡️ Workstation = Actual place or equipment where a specific Laptop manufacturing step physically happens.




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


7. Routing


🔹 Purpose / Role

- A Routing defines the sequence of operations needed to manufacture an item — in other words, it tells “which operations happen, in what order, and where.”
- It connects Operations and Workstations together to create a complete production flow.

When you attach a Routing to a BOM, ERPNext knows exactly how the manufacturing will progress — from the first step to the last.



🔹 Real-World Example (Laptop Manufacturing)

For your Laptop, the manufacturing process goes through several steps:

1. Assemble Components → done at Assembly Table A
2. Software Installation → done at Software Setup Station
3. Quality Testing → done at Testing Bench 1
4. Packaging → done at Packaging Unit 2

You can define all these steps in one Routing called Laptop Production Routing.
Then, when you create the BOM for Laptop, you link this Routing so ERPNext knows the order of operations and the workstations to use.


➡️ Routing = The roadmap or workflow showing how the Laptop moves through different operations and workstations during manufacturing.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



8. Stock Entry ( Material Transfer for Manufacture )

- Material Transfer for Manufacture is a type of Stock Entry used to move raw materials from the main warehouse (or stores) to the production floor/workstation location 
  before starting manufacturing.
- It ensures that all required components are available where production actually happens.

It doesn’t consume or produce anything yet — it’s just a transfer step in the manufacturing flow.




Real-World Example (Laptop Manufacturing)

- Your store has raw materials like:
100 Motherboards
100 Screens
100 Keyboards
100 Batteries

- Now, a Work Order is created to manufacture 50 Laptops.

- Before starting assembly, you need to send materials from the Main Warehouse to the Assembly Area.

So you create a Stock Entry of type “Material Transfer for Manufacture” that moves:
- 50 Motherboards
- 50 Screens
- 50 Keyboards
- 50 Batteries 
      …to the workstation’s location.

Once the materials reach the production area, actual assembly (manufacturing) can begin.



➡️ Material Transfer for Manufacture = Moving raw materials from the main store to the production floor before Laptop assembly starts.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


9. Job Card

- A Job Card represents the actual work record for a specific operation in the manufacturing process.
- It tracks who performed the task, at which workstation, how long it took, and how much quantity was completed.

It’s created automatically (or manually) from a Work Order, based on the operations defined in its BOM or Routing.



🔹 Real-World Example (Laptop Manufacturing)

You have a Work Order to make 50 Laptops.
According to your Routing, the first operation is “Assemble Components” done at Assembly Table A.

ERPNext automatically creates a Job Card for this operation.
Your technician — say Rahul — starts the job, records:
- Start Time and End Time
- Quantity completed (e.g., 50 Laptops assembled)
- Any downtime or remarks

After completion, this Job Card serves as a record of that operation’s work.
Then the next Job Card (for Software Installation) can begin, and so on, until all operations are completed.


➡️ Job Card = Work log for each operation step, tracking time, employee, and progress during Laptop manufacturing.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


10. Stock Entry ( Manufacture )


🔹 Purpose / Role

- A Stock Entry of type “Manufacture” represents the completion of the production process — it consumes raw materials and adds the finished product to stock.
- It’s the final step in manufacturing where ERPNext updates the inventory to show that finished goods are now ready.

This entry is usually created when a Work Order is completed.



🔹 Real-World Example (Laptop Manufacturing)

After all operations (Assembly, Software Installation, Testing, Packaging) are done for 50 Laptops, you’re ready to record the finished goods.

You create a Stock Entry (Manufacture) that:

Consumes:
- 50 Motherboards
- 50 Screens
- 50 Keyboards
- 50 Batteries
- 50 Laptop Bodies

Produces:
- 50 Finished Laptops


ERPNext automatically calculates the cost of production based on consumed items and operation costs, and adds 50 Laptops to the Finished Goods Warehouse.


➡️ Stock Entry (Manufacture) = The final production entry that converts raw materials into finished Laptops and updates stock accordingly.

 ✅ Doctyoe with Each Field =====



1. Bill of Materials (BOM) ----  

1️⃣ PRODUCTION ITEM SECTION

| Field                                      | Meaning                                                |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Item                                       | Finished product to be manufactured/repacked.          |
| Item UOM                                   | Unit of measure of finished product.                   |
| Quantity                                   | Quantity of finished product produced per BOM.         |
| Is Active                                  | BOM is usable in manufacturing.                        |
| Is Default                                 | System will use this BOM automatically.                |
| Allow Alternative Item                     | Allows raw material substitution.                      |
| Set rate of sub-assembly item based on BOM | Use BOM cost for sub-assemblies instead of item price. |
| Project                                    | Link BOM to a project.                                 |


here,

1. Set rate of sub-assembly item based on BOM :
- In ERPNext, when an item inside a BOM has its own BOM (a sub-assembly), the system automatically sets its rate using the total cost calculated 
  from that sub-assembly’s BOM instead of using the item’s purchase rate or valuation rate.

⭐ Expanded Definition (Clear & Practical)
When building a BOM in ERPNext:
- If an item is a raw material → ERPNext uses its valuation rate or last purchase rate.
- If an item is a sub-assembly (it has its own BOM) → ERPNext uses the total cost of its BOM as the rate.


ERPNext calculates this by:
- Reading the sub-assembly’s BOM.
- Summing all material + operation costs.
- Assigning this cost as the “Rate” in the parent BOM.

For example, 

finished good BOM - 

| Sub-Assembly / Raw Item | Qty | Rate Source    | Rate | Amount |
| ----------------------- | --- | -------------- | ---- | ------ |
| Motherboard Assembly    | 1   | Valuation Rate | 91   | 91     |
| Screen Assembly         | 1   | **From BOM**   | 60   | 60     |
| Keyboard                | 1   | Valuation Rate | 15   | 15     |
| Battery Pack            | 1   | Valuation Rate | 30   | 30     |
| SSD                     | 1   | Valuation Rate | 20   | 20     |
| Laptop Body             | 1   | Valuation Rate | 25   | 25     |
| Charger                 | 1   | Valuation Rate | 12   | 12     |
| Packaging Box           | 1   | Valuation Rate | 5    | 5      |

now for screen assembly we have BOM for that

| Item      | Qty | Rate | Amount |
| --------- | --- | ---- | ------ |
| LCD Panel | 1   | 50   | 50     |
| Touch Pad | 1   | 10   | 10     |

👉 Total Screen Cost = 60

 ERPNext sets:  Rate(Screen Assembly) = 60


---------------------

2. ALternative items

In ERPNext, “Alternative Item in BOM” is always for raw materials or components, NOT for finished goods or sub-assemblies.

When creating a Work Order, ERPNext checks stock:
- If Battery Pack A is in stock → use it
- If Battery Pack A is out of stock → ERPNext shows:

“Alternative Item Available: Battery Pack B”
You can choose Battery Pack B with one click.

note :
- Battery A and Battery B must both be RAW MATERIAL items.
- you need to set it in the Item Alternative doctype, Then in the BOM, Battery A (raw material) can be replaced with Battery B (another raw material).


---------------------

3. Quantity
- “Quantity (Finished Items)” is the number of final products produced from a single execution of this BOM and its materials.”


⭐ Simple Rule to Remember
✔ If BOM produces 1 item → enter raw materials for 1 unit
✔ If BOM produces 10 items → enter raw materials for 10 units
✔ ERPNext DOES NOT multiply raw materials automatically inside the BOM



📌 Important Point (Very Important)
❗In the BOM, the raw material table shows the actual quantity needed for the BOM’s total output.

ERPNext only divides or multiplies later (during costing or work order), not inside the BOM.

calculation on costing :
- ERPNext divides the raw material cost by this quantity to get the cost per finished item.

Example:

Total material cost = ₹500
Quantity = 5
Cost per unit = 500 ÷ 5 = ₹100

------------------------


2️⃣ COST CONFIGURATION

| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Finished Goods based Operating Cost** | Operation cost is calculated **per finished item**, not per operation/time.                                                     |
| **Operating Cost Per BOM Quantity**     | Enter total operating cost for the BOM output. If filled, ERPNext **ignores operation-wise cost** and uses this value directly. |

here,

1. Finished Goods based Operating Cost
- If this is checked, ERPNext calculates the operating (labor/overhead) cost per finished item, instead of calculating it based on " operation time or workstation rate ".

ex. 
BOM produces 10 laptops

  Total operating cost = ₹500

If this setting is ON:
- Operating cost per laptop = 500 ÷ 10 = ₹50

--------------------

2. Operating Cost Per BOM Quantity
- This is the total operating (labor/overhead) cost for producing the entire BOM quantity. If you enter a value here, ERPNext will ignore 
  operation-wise time and workstation costs and use this value directly.
  
⭐ Simplest Explanation
You manually tell ERPNext: 👉 “This whole BOM costs X amount in labor/operations.”
- ERPNext will not calculate operation cost automatically.  

so it is : A manual override field to directly set the total operating cost for the BOM’s output.

note :
1. 
- Operating Cost Per BOM Quantity is for the whole BOM batch, not per finished item.
 
So if your BOM produces 2 laptops, and you set: Operating Cost Per BOM Quantity = 200


Then ERPNext will treat it like this:
- Total operating cost for producing 2 laptops = 200
- Operating cost per laptop = 200 ÷ 2 = 100


---------------------


3. Transfer Material Against
✅ When Transfer Material Against = Work Order
- You usually create ONE stock entry (Material Transfer for Manufacture).
- This stock entry transfers all required raw materials for the entire production batch.
- Materials are issued once per Work Order.

✔ One Work Order → One Material Transfer for Manufacture

👉 Example
1 Work Order → 1 Material Transfer for Manufacture → All Job Cards can begin.


✅ When Transfer Material Against = Job Card
- You create a stock entry for each operation, based on the Job Card.

- Each job card can require different materials.
- Materials are issued operation-wise, not all at once.

✔ Multiple operations → Multiple Material Transfer for Manufacture entries

Example:
If you have 3 operations in the routing:
Cutting
Welding
Painting

You may end up creating 3 stock entries, one per job card.

👉 Example
Operation 1 → 1 Material Transfer for Manufacture
Operation 2 → 1 Material Transfer for Manufacture
Operation 3 → 1 Material Transfer for Manufacture

- always Stock Entry Type = Material Transfer for Manufacture



5️⃣ SCRAP & PROCESS LOSS

WHAT IS SCRAP ITEM ? 

When you manufacture something:
- Some material is used
- Some material becomes scrap (waste, off-cuts, unusable pieces, leftover material)
- ERPNext allows you to define this scrap in the BOM so it can be:

✔ Tracked
✔ Added to stock (if reusable)
✔ Valued
✔ Sold later

| --------- | -------------------------------- |
| Item Code | Scrap generated from production. |
| Qty       | Quantity of scrap.               |

| **Manufacturing Type**     | Indicates whether in-house or subcontracted.          |

here in the table,

- You don’t need to manually enter data in these tables.
- ERPNext automatically fetches all required items using the “Get Items” buttons.

so When you click Get Sub Assembly Items, system auto-fetches all sub-assemblies from the BOM tree.
➡️ No manual entry required.

here,

1. Consolidate Sub Assembly Items
- merges the same sub-assembly items into a single combined requirement so you can create one Work Order for the total quantity.

   If multiple finished products need the same sub-assembly, ERPNext will merge them into one line instead of many separate lines.


🧩 Think of it like this

You are making:
 Laptop A = 5 units
 Laptop B = 3 units

Both laptops use the same sub-assembly: Battery Pack

- Without consolidation, ERPNext lists this:

Battery Pack – 5 (for Laptop A)
Battery Pack – 3 (for Laptop B)

- With consolidation ON:

Battery Pack – 8 (combined)


If an item has a BOM → ERPNext thinks it must be MANUFACTURED → so it creates a Work Order.
If an item has NO BOM → ERPNext thinks it is a RAW MATERIAL → no Work Order.

That's it.


🧩 Case 1 — Battery has no BOM

Battery = raw material
Expected behavior:

❌ No Work Order
✔ Only Material Request (purchase/transfer)

🧩 Case 2 — Battery has its own BOM

Battery Pack = assembled from cells and wiring
Battery Pack = sub-assembly
Expected behavior:

✔ ERPNext will create a Work Order
❌ It will NOT show it in raw materials
✔ It will show it under Sub-Assembly Items



note : 
✅ If Battery is a Sub-Assembly (has its own BOM)

AND you use it as a raw material inside Laptop BOM…**
👉 ERPNext WILL create a Work Order for each required Battery.

Why?

Because ERPNext thinks: “Battery is not a raw material. Battery has a BOM, so it must be MANUFACTURED.”

So yes:

✔ If you link a sub-assembly item inside Laptop BOM
✔ ERPNext will generate Work Orders for that sub-assembly
✔ Either 1 work order per unit or a consolidated one (if consolidation is ON)




🧩 Example
Battery Pack (Sub-Assembly)
- Has BOM
- Requires lithium cells, wiring, BMS module
- Marked as “Is Manufactured Item”

Laptop BOM:
- Uses Battery Pack as a component

Production Plan:
- If you produce 5 laptops →

ERPNext will say: Make 5 Battery Packs (Work Order)


Because Battery Pack is not a raw material,
it is a manufactured sub-assembly.


so in simple ::::::::::

✅ 1️⃣ When you TICK “Consolidate Sub Assembly Items”

ERPNext will create ONE Work Order for the total required quantity.

Example:

You produce 5 Laptops
Each laptop needs 1 Battery Pack (sub-assembly)

With Consolidate ON:

👉 ERPNext creates ONE Work Order:

Work Order:
Battery Pack – Qty: 5

✔ Clean
✔ Single WO
✔ Easy to manage

You are right.



❌ 2️⃣ When you DO NOT TICK “Consolidate Sub Assembly Items”
ERPNext creates SEPARATE Work Orders for each demand.

Example:
Laptop 1 → Battery Pack (WO 1)
Laptop 2 → Battery Pack (WO 2)
Laptop 3 → Battery Pack (WO 3)
Laptop 4 → Battery Pack (WO 4)
Laptop 5 → Battery Pack (WO 5)

👉 5 different Work Orders
(very messy)

You are right again.	

Final THought : ✅ “Consolidate Sub Assembly Items” is ONLY useful when your main BOM contains sub-assemblies.



 
--------------------------

2. Skip Available Sub Assembly Items

:) If this checkbox is ON (✔ Skip Available Sub Assembly Items):

ERPNext says: “We already have 4 in stock…

- So create Work Order only for the missing 6.”
- It creates: Work Order → Battery Pack → Qty 6

:) If this checkbox is OFF (❌ unchecked):

- ERPNext ignores the stock and creates:

Work Order → Battery Pack → Qty 10

- Even though 4 are already available — this wastes resources.


------------------------------

Sub Assembly Warehouse = The warehouse where ERPNext checks stock of sub-assembly items

| **Plan to Request Qty** | Final quantity after applying safety stock, stock availability, MOQ, transfer/purchase logic. |

- ERPNext automatically decides whether you need to Purchase or Transfer.

here,

1. Include Non Stock Items

Meaning:
If some items are services or non-stock (not stored in warehouse), include them in planning.

Example: Design Fee, Inspection Service, Packaging Service
- Normally they are not stock items, but checking this will include them.


- ERPNext normally plans only stock items (items stored in a warehouse).
But sometimes your BOM contains items that are: Services (not physical), Non-stock items (not stored in warehouse), One-time charges

If you check Include Non Stock Items, ERPNext will ALSO plan these items during Material Request Planning.


⭐ Why is this useful?
Because some production processes cannot continue without these services.

Example:
- Laptop motherboard must be programmed, done by an external service.
- Laptop body requires painting, done by a painting vendor.
- Packaging boxes need printing, done by a print shop.

If ERPNext ignores these services, your production plan will be incomplete.

----------------

2. Include Subcontracted Items

Meaning:
Include items that must be sent to a subcontractor.

Example:
- If Motherboard Assembly is completed by a subcontractor → ERPNext will consider raw materials for subcontracting.

⭐ What happens when checkbox is ON?

ERPNext will:

✔ Calculate how many IC chips are needed
✔ Plan to buy them
✔ Plan to send them to subcontractor
✔ Ensure subcontractor can produce the sub-assembly
✔ Ensure you receive the finished motherboard
✔ Ensure final laptop assembly continues smoothly

This makes the entire production flow correct.

🧩 REAL Example (very simple)

You want to produce 10 laptops.

Motherboard Assembly (subcontracted) needs:
1 PCB Board
5 IC chips
20 capacitors

If the checkbox is ON:

ERPNext calculates total qty needed:
PCB Board = 10
IC Chips = 50
Capacitors = 200

- ERPNext creates Material Requests to buy these items.
- You send them to subcontractor → subcontractor builds motherboard → you assemble laptop.

----------------

3. Consider Minimum Order Qty

Meaning:
Apply supplier’s MOQ rule.

Example:
You need 5 screens
Supplier’s MOQ = 10
ERPNext will request 10, not 5.

where set this MOQ :

1. Go to: Item
2. Open the item (example: Screen)
3. Scroll to section: Purchase
4. Inside it you will see: Item Supplier Table
5. In each supplier row you will find a field called: Minimum Order Qty


----------------

4. Include Safety Stock in Required Qty Calculation

Meaning:
Add safety stock to the required raw materials.

Example:
BOM requires 20 batteries
Safety stock = 5
ERPNext will request 25 batteries.


In Item Master, the item has: Safety Stock = 5 Batteries
----------------

5. Ignore Available Stock

Meaning:
Create Material Request even if you already have stock.

Example:
You need 10 SSDs
Stock available = 20

If this is ON:
ERPNext will still create a request for 10 more.
Useful when you want fresh materials or dedicated stock.

----------------

5️⃣ OTHER DETAILS
| Field                  | Meaning                                             |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Total Planned Qty**  | Sum of all planned quantities in the plan.          |
| **Total Produced Qty** | Total quantity actually produced (auto-calculated). |
| **Status**             | Current status (Draft, Submitted, Completed, etc.). |


----------------------------------

other fields :  

1. 
Consolidate Sales Order Items
- When this checkbox is enabled, ERPNext will:
✔ Merge / combine identical items from different Sales Orders
✔ Create ONE Work Order for total quantity instead of multiple
✔ Reduce duplication
✔ Plan production more efficiently


Suppose you have 3 Sales Orders

| Sales Order | Item   | Qty |
| ----------- | ------ | --- |
| SO-001      | Laptop | 10  |
| SO-002      | Laptop | 5   |
| SO-003      | Laptop | 7   |

👉 With Consolidate Sales Order Items = Checked
ERPNext will combine all 3: Laptop → total qty 22

And create one Work Order for 22 units
(or as many as allowed by maximum work order quantity).


👉 With Consolidate Sales Order Items = Unchecked
- ERPNext will create separate Work Orders:
Work Order for 10
Work Order for 5
Work Order for 7

Switches / Flags

| Field                                                       | Meaning                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Allow Alternative Item**                                  | Allow use of alternative raw materials.              |
| **Use Multi-Level BOM**                                     | Plan raw materials for sub-assemblies also.          |
| **Skip Material Transfer to WIP Warehouse**                 | Do not require stock transfer to WIP.                |
| **Backflush Raw Materials From Work-in-Progress Warehouse** | Auto-consume materials from WIP warehouse at finish. |
| **Update Consumed Material Cost In Project**                | Update cost of materials to project accounting.      |

here,
1. 
1. Allow Alternative Item
✔️ This allows the system to use alternative raw materials if the original item is unavailable.

--------------------

2. Use Multi-Level BOM
✔️ If enabled, ERPNext will plan materials not only for the final item, but also for all sub-assemblies inside the main BOM.
📌 Without this, the system uses only the top-level BOM and assumes sub-assemblies already exist.

Real-World Example:
You manufacture a bicycle.

Final bicycle BOM contains:
Frame Assembly
Wheel Assembly
Handle Assembly

Each assembly has its own BOM (multi-level).

If this option is enabled:
→ ERPNext will plan raw materials for each assembly (e.g., spokes, rim, ball bearings, rods).

If disabled:
→ ERPNext expects Frame Assembly, Wheel Assembly, etc. to already be in stock.


--------------------

3. Skip Material Transfer to WIP Warehouse
✔️ When checked, ERPNext will not require moving materials to a Work-In-Progress (WIP) warehouse before production.

👍 Useful if:
- You don't track WIP warehouses, or
- Materials go directly to the production floor.

Real-World Example:

A bakery produces bread.

They store flour, sugar, and yeast in their main warehouse.
They don't track a special "WIP Warehouse" for mixing dough.

If this option is enabled:
→ Workers can directly consume flour & ingredients from the main warehouse.
→ No need to do a stock entry to move materials into a WIP warehouse.

👍 So, do you still need to create Material Transfer for Manufacture?
No.

- If you enable Skip Material Transfer, you do NOT need to create a Material Transfer stock entry.

You will create only one stock entry: Manufacture

And ERPNext automatically consumes materials directly from their source warehouse.

so- > you CAN create Job Cards without Material Transfer if this option is enabled

---------------

4. Backflush Raw Materials From Work-in-Progress Warehouse
✔️ Automatically consumes (deducts) raw material stock only at the time of finishing the Work Order.
🔄 You don’t need to manually create stock entries for each consumption step.
⚠️ Works best when your production process is simple and material usage closely matches BOM.


Real-World Example:

An electronics company is making 100 LED bulbs.

Materials needed per bulb:
- 1 LED chip
- 1 plastic body
- 2 wires

Instead of manually consuming materials each time:
- They finish production
- Submit the Work Order
- ERPNext automatically reduces raw materials based on BOM qty × 100 bulbs

In normal manufacturing:
- You first transfer raw materials to WIP Warehouse.
- Later ERPNext consumes (backflushes) them from the WIP Warehouse.

This option allows:
- Auto-consumption of materials already sitting in WIP Warehouse.

some error - if i do skip option then blackflush will not work because erp never consume raw materials from different warehouses if focus only one .... 
--------------
	
5. Update Consumed Material Cost In Project
✔️ If the Work Order is linked to a Project, the cost of raw materials consumed will be added to the Project’s cost.
💰 Helps with project profitability tracking and accounting accuracy.

1️⃣ BASIC DETAILS

| Field                       | Meaning                                             |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**                    | Name of the manufacturing operation (process name). |
| **Is Corrective Operation** | Marks this operation as corrective/rework type.     |
| **Default Workstation**     | Workstation automatically used for this operation.  |

here

1. Is Corrective Operation

Scenario:

You run a factory that makes metal brackets.

Normal operations (standard process):
Cutting
Bending
Drilling
Painting
Final Inspection

What happens:

During inspection, workers find that 10 brackets have paint defects.

To fix them, they perform:
Paint Touch-Up
Re-inspection

These steps are not part of the original BOM operations — they are rework.

So in ERPNext:

You create or add an operation called “Paint Touch-Up”
→ Check Is Corrective Operation


-------------------



2️⃣ JOB CARD SETTINGS

| Field                                   | Meaning                                                 |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Create Job Card based on Batch Size** | Creates multiple Job Cards depending on batch size.     |
| **Batch Size**                          | Number of units handled per Job Card.                   |
| **Quality Inspection Template**         | Template used for quality checks during this operation. |

here,

1. Create Job Card based on Batch Size
- ERPNext will automatically create multiple Job Cards instead of one, based on the batch size you set.


Work Order Quantity: 1000 LED bulbs
- Your worker can only handle 100 bulbs at a time for the assembly operation.

If you enable:
- Create Job Card based on Batch Size = YES
- Batch Size = 100

ERPNext generates 10 Job Cards:

Job Card 1 → 100 bulbs  
Job Card 2 → 100 bulbs  
Job Card 3 → 100 bulbs  
...  
Job Card 10 → 100 bulbs


---------------------

2. Batch Size
- The number of units to be processed per Job Card.

✅ Real-World Example

Manufacturing Plastic Bottles
Work Order Qty = 5000 bottles
Batch Size = 500 bottles

ERPNext will make: 5000 ÷ 500 = 10 job cards

9. Manufacturing Settings

1️⃣ TAB: BOM AND PRODUCTION

Raw Materials Consumption

| Field                                             | Meaning                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Allow Continuous Material Consumption**         | Allow consuming raw materials even if finished goods are not yet produced. |
| **Backflush Raw Materials Based On**              | Determines how raw materials are auto-consumed (BOM or Material Transfer). |
| **Get Raw Materials Cost from Consumption Entry** | Use cost based on actual consumption entries.                              |
| **Validate Components and Quantities Per BOM**    | Enforce checking raw materials strictly against BOM.                       |

here,

1. Allow Continuous Material Consumption

by default it is off:
👉 ERPNext will not reduce raw material stock when you start making something.
👉 ERPNext will reduce the stock only at the moment you declare the finished item.

Raw materials are consumed gradually during production, even before the product is finished

✔ How ERPNext behaves:
- You can create multiple Material Consumption Entries(stock entry) while production is ongoing
- Stock of raw materials goes down step-by-step
- The finished item is added to stock only at the end

🔧 Stock Entries created:
- Many small Material Consumption entries
- One Finished Goods entry at the end

real world example-

A Cookie Bakery

Raw Materials:
Flour
Sugar
Butter

Finished Product:
1 Batch of Cookies

🟪 When setting is OFF (Default)
- ERPNext assumes a simple situation:
- You consume(stock changes) the ingredients only when cookies are fully baked.


Real ERPNext flow:
  1. Start Work Order → stock unchanged
  2. Mix dough → stock unchanged
  3. Bake → stock unchanged
  4. Cookies finished → ERPNext reduces flour, sugar, butter
  5. ERPNext adds batch of cookies to stock


🟩 When setting is ON (Continuous Consumption)

- ERPNext assumes a more complex, realistic scenario: Ingredients are consumed as soon as you put them into the mixing bowl.

Real ERPNext flow:

1. Add flour → ERPNext immediately reduces flour stock
2. Add sugar → ERPNext reduces sugar stock
3. Add butter → ERPNext reduces butter stock
4. Bake cookies
5. After baking → ERPNext adds finished cookies to stock

note : here i need to create stock entries but ERPNext will automatically create: Finished Goods Stock Entry

-------------------------

2. Backflush Raw Materials Based On
- This decides HOW ERPNext auto-consumes(stock changes) raw materials when you finish a Work Order.( Stock Entry (Manufacture) )

A. BOM
- ERPNext will consume raw materials based only on the quantities defined in the BOM.

🧿 Real-world example

BOM says:
- 5 kg flour
- 2 kg sugar
- 1 kg butter

When you finish production, ERPNext automatically consumes 5 + 2 + 1 kg exactly.
Even if you transferred more or less, ERPNext still uses BOM values.

✔ When choosing BOM:
- Raw materials are consumed automatically when the Work Order is completed.
- ERPNext looks at the BOM and deducts materials exactly as listed.
- No need for Material Transfer entries.


B. Material Transfer
- ERPNext will consume raw materials based on the quantities you actually transferred to the Work Order, not the BOM.

🧿 Real-world example

You transferred:
12 kg flour
3 kg sugar

Even if the BOM says flour = 10 kg, ERPNext will consume 12 kg because that’s what was transferred.


✔ When choosing Material Transfer:
- ERPNext waits for your “Material Transfer for Manufacture” stock entries.
- Whatever quantity you transferred → ERPNext consumes that exact amount.
- If you transferred 12 kg instead of 10 kg, ERPNext consumes 12 kg.


-------------------------

3. Get Raw Materials Cost from Consumption Entry ( open if you choose Allow Continuous Material Consumption )

- ERPNext will calculate the cost of finished goods based on the actual material consumption entries you made, not based on " BOM ".

🏭 Real-World Example
You make 100 T-shirts

BOM says:
2 meters cloth per shirt
Total: 200 meters cloth

But in real production:
- Workers consumed 210 meters cloth (10 meters wasted)

- You created Material Consumption entries showing 210 meters used.

✔ If Setting is ON
ERPNext uses 210 meters cost to value finished goods.
This shows real cost, including wastage.

✘ If Setting is OFF
ERPNext ignores real consumption.
It uses 200 meters from BOM, even though you consumed more.


-------------------------


4. Validate Components and Quantities Per BOM
- controls whether ERPNext should strictly enforce that all raw materials (components) and their quantities match the Bill of Materials (BOM) whenever you create:
  Work Orders
  Stock Entries (Manufacture / Repack)
  Production Planning
  Subassemblies 
  ....

✅ What this setting does

When enabled:

1. Only the exact items listed in the BOM can be used. You cannot add extra raw materials or remove any BOM item.

2. Quantities must match the BOM, unless you explicitly change the BOM or set tolerances.
-  If your Stock Entry uses more or less than the BOM quantity, ERPNext will throw a validation error.

3. Prevents accidental mistakes like:
- Using the wrong component
- Using incorrect qty
- Producing using an outdated BOM

It enforces strict BOM compliance for controlled manufacturing environments.


❌ When disabled :

You are allowed to:
- Add materials not listed in the BOM
- Change quantities freely
- Ignore mismatches between BOM and stock entry / work order consumption

Good for flexible or manual production processes.




BOM

| Field                             | Meaning                                                     |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Update BOM Cost Automatically** | Scheduler updates BOM cost using latest material valuation. |

here,

1. Update BOM Cost Automatically
- When this option is enabled, ERPNext will automatically recalculate (update) the cost of all Bill of Materials (BOMs) whenever the following change:
   - Item price changes (valuation rate)
   - Raw material cost updates
   - Sub-assemblies’ BOM costs change
   - A user manually triggers a BOM update


✔️ What Happens Internally

If enabled, ERPNext will:
- Fetch the latest cost of each raw material (based on valuation rate or price list).
- Recalculate the Total Cost and Per Unit Cost of the BOM.
- Save the updated cost back to the BOM automatically.

This ensures manufacturing costing stays accurate without needing to manually click "Update Cost" on every BOM.




Default Warehouses for Production

| Field                                  | Meaning                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Default Work In Progress Warehouse** | Default warehouse for WIP items.         |
| **Default Finished Goods Warehouse**   | Default warehouse for finished products. |
| **Default Scrap Warehouse**            | Default warehouse for storing scrap.     |




Overproduction for Sales and Work Order

| Field                                         | Meaning                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Overproduction Percentage For Sales Order** | Allowed extra production percentage above sales order qty. |
| **Overproduction Percentage For Work Order**  | Allowed extra production percentage above work order qty.  |

here,

ex. 

Sales Order Qty = 100 pcs
Overproduction Percentage = 10%
Allowed Production Qty = 100 + 10% = 110 pcs

&

Work Order Qty: 200 units
Overproduction % for Work Order: 8%
Allowed Qty to Produce: 200 × 1.08 = 216 units


2️⃣ TAB: JOB CARD AND CAPACITY PLANNING


Job Card Settings

| Field                                                        | Meaning                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Add Corrective Operation Cost in Finished Good Valuation** | Add cost of corrective operations in FG cost. |
| **Enforce Time Logs**                                        | Force job card to have From Time and To Time. |

here,

1. Add Corrective Operation Cost in Finished Good Valuation
During manufacturing, a Work Order includes:

Raw Materials cost
- Operation cost (from Workstations / Operation rates)
- Additional expenses

Sometimes, during the process, the actual operation cost ends up higher or lower than what was originally estimated.
- These differences are called Corrective Operation Costs.

If “Add Corrective Operation Cost in Finished Good Valuation” is enabled:
→ ERPNext includes these corrected (actual) operation costs into the final valuation of the finished goods.

If disabled:
→ ERPNext ignores the corrected operation costs and only uses the originally estimated operation rates for valuation.

-------------------------

2. Enforce Time Logs

When this setting is enabled, ERPNext forces users to create Time Logs for each operation performed in a Work Order.
This ensures actual machine/labor time is captured before the operation can be marked complete.

In short:
You cannot complete manufacturing operations without entering Time Logs.

✔️ What Happens When It Is ENABLED
ERPNext requires:
- Job Cards → Time Log entry
- Actual Start Time / End Time
- Operation hours
- Optional: Machine, employee, workstation



Material Transfer

| Field                              | Meaning                                                       |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Allow Excess Material Transfer** | Allow transferring more raw materials than required quantity. |

here,

1. Allow Excess Material Transfer 
- Every Work Order calculates the required quantity of raw materials based on the BOM.

Example:
If the BOM requires 10 kg of a material, ERPNext expects exactly 10 kg to be transferred from the warehouse to WIP.

When Allow Excess Material Transfer = ON:
→ You can transfer more than the required quantity, such as 11 kg, 12 kg, etc.
ERPNext will NOT block the transfer.

When Allow Excess Material Transfer = OFF:
→ ERPNext will block transfers that exceed the Work Order requirement.
You will see an error like: “Transferred quantity cannot exceed required quantity.”



Capacity Planning

| Field                              | Meaning                                                |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Disable Capacity Planning**      | Turn off workstation capacity planning.                |
| **Allow Overtime**                 | Allow planning work outside workstation working hours. |
| **Allow Production on Holidays**   | Allow scheduling production on holidays.               |
| **Capacity Planning For (Days)**   | Number of days to plan manufacturing operations ahead. |
| **Time Between Operations (Mins)** | Time gap between sequential operations.                |

here,

1. Disable Capacity Planning

When Disable Capacity Planning = ON

ERPNext IGNORES:
- Workstation capacity (e.g., machine hours per day)
- Operation scheduling
- Overlaps or overbooking of machines
- Production load on workstations

Work Orders can be created and scheduled freely without any capacity checks.

➡️ In simple words: No scheduling → No capacity limits → Just create Work Orders anytime.


When Disable Capacity Planning = OFF (capacity planning is enabled)

ERPNext will:
- Check available machine hours
- Prevent scheduling beyond available capacity
- Schedule operations in a Gantt chart or timeline
- Ensure operations don’t overlap when not allowed
- Follow workstation timing rules (e.g., 8 hours/day)

If a machine/workstation is fully booked, ERPNext shows errors like: “Not enough capacity on Workstation ‘X’ for this operation.”

-------------------------

2. Allow Overtime

Each Workstation has defined:
- Working Hours per Day (e.g., 8 hours/day)
- A Holiday List
- Capacity planning rules

When ERPNext schedules production, it normally cannot exceed those working hours.

If Allow Overtime = ON → ERPNext can schedule more than the defined capacity.
If Allow Overtime = OFF → ERPNext blocks or reschedules any production that exceeds available hours.


✔️ Example to Understand
Workstation Capacity:
- Working Hours: 8 hours/day

Operation Requirement for a Work Order:
- Required: 10 hours

🔹 If Allow Overtime = OFF
ERPNext schedules:
- Day 1 → 8 hrs
- Day 2 → 2 hrs

Because ERPNext cannot exceed daily capacity.

🔹 If Allow Overtime = ON
- ERPNext schedules everything in one day, even though 10 hrs > 8 hrs.

Meaning:
✔ Work Order fully scheduled in 1 day
✔ Machine is considered to work overtime
✔ No splitting into multiple days


-------------------------


3. Allow Production on Holidays
- Every Workstation in ERPNext has a Holiday List (e.g., Sundays, national holidays, shutdown days).

Normally, ERPNext will avoid scheduling production on those holiday dates.

Allow Production on Holidays = ON -> ERPNext can schedule operations even on holiday dates.
Allow Production on Holidays = OFF -> ERPNext prevents operations from being scheduled on holidays.


-------------------------


4. Capacity Planning For (Days)
-  ERPNext will plan and schedule your production only for the next X days

Example:

If you set Capacity Planning For = 30 days
ERPNext plans and schedules production 30 days into the future.

If you set Capacity Planning For = 7 days
ERPNext only schedules production for one week ahead.


✔️ Example Scenario
Assume:
- Workstation: 8 hrs/day
- Required operation time: 40 hours


🔹 Capacity Planning For = 3 days
Planning window = 3 days
Available hours = 8 * 3 = 24 hrs

➡️ ERPNext will only schedule 24 hours worth of operations
➡️ Remaining 16 hours will not be scheduled (or ERPNext will throw a capacity conflict error)

🔹 Capacity Planning For = 10 days
Available hours = 8 * 10 = 80 hrs

➡️ ERPNext can easily fit the 40-hour job
➡️ Schedules it properly over several days

✔️ In Simple Words

| Setting                     | Meaning                      |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Small number (5–7 days)** | Short-term scheduling window |
| **Medium (15–30 days)**     | Normal production planning   |
| **Large (60–90 days)**      | Long-term factory scheduling |


✔️ When Should You Change This?
Set LOW value (e.g., 7–14 days) if:
- Your production changes frequently
- You want short-term flexible schedules
- You have dynamic orders

Set HIGH value (30+ days) if:
- You have long Work Orders
- You plan production monthly or quarterly
- You want to schedule long projects in advance


note :
- to schedule remaining days, to complete work order you need to change this days(mention in Capacity Planning For (Days)), erpnext not allow  automatically schedule that work ..

-------------------------

5. Time Between Operations (Mins) 
- This is the waiting time between two operations in a Work Order.

Example:
- Operation 1 finishes at 10:00 AM
- Time Between Operations = 30 minutes
- Operation 2 will be scheduled to start at 10:30 AM

If you set:
- Time Between Operations = 15 minutes
- Then every operation in the Work Order will have a 15-minute gap before the next one starts.

note :
- this is just for planning, you can still create job card for that operation if gap is not full filled. 








Other Settings

| Field                                                    | Meaning                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Set Operating Cost / Scrap Items From Sub-assemblies** | Include sub-assembly costs/scrap in finished goods without using a job card. |
| **Make Serial No / Batch from Work Order**               | Auto-generate serial/batch numbers when work order is submitted.             |

here,

1. Set Operating Cost / Scrap Items From Sub-assemblies
- This setting tells ERPNext: 
            When a BOM has sub-assemblies, should ERPNext also include their operating cost and scrap items in the final calculation?

✔️ Breaking It Down
🔹 1. Sub-assemblies
- These are BOMs inside another BOM.
Example:

Main Product BOM
└── Sub-Assembly A BOM
└── Sub-Assembly B BOM

Each sub-assembly may have:
- Operating cost (machine/labor)
- Scrap items


✔ When ENABLED (ON)
- ERPNext will pull operating cost and scrap items of sub-assemblies into the main BOM / main Work Order.

Meaning:
- Sub-assembly operation cost is added to final cost
- Scrap generated in sub-assembly is included
- Your costing becomes fully accurate

Example

Sub-assembly has:
- Operating cost = 50
- Scrap = 2 kg

Main BOM will now include:
+50 operating cost
+2 kg scrap


❌ When DISABLED (OFF)
- ERPNext ignores the operating cost and scrap of sub-assemblies.

Meaning:
- Only direct BOM operations & scrap are counted
- Sub-assembly costs are NOT included
- Costing becomes simpler but maybe less accurate

-------------------------

2. Make Serial No / Batch from Work Order
- This setting tells ERPNext:
        Automatically create Serial Numbers or Batch Numbers for the finished goods when you complete a Work Order.


✔️ Why This Matters
- Many factories produce items that must have:
Serial Numbers (unique per piece)
Batch Numbers (group of pieces made together)

ERPNext can create these automatically during manufacturing if this setting is ON.


✔️ What Happens When Setting is ON
When you complete a Work Order:
- ERPNext will generate Serial Numbers (if the item is serialized)
- ERPNext will generate a Batch Number (if the item is batched)

You don’t need to manually create them.


Example:

Finished Item: “Pump Motor”
Item has Serial Number Required = Yes

Work Order produces 10 units
➡️ ERPNext automatically creates 10 serial numbers
➡️ They get assigned to the finished goods stock entry

(Same for Batch items)


✔️ What Happens When Setting is OFF
- ERPNext will NOT create serial or batch numbers automatically.

You must:
- create Batch manually
- or create Serial Numbers manually
- or select an existing Batch

If you forget → ERPNext blocks the stock entry.


✔️ Ultra Simple Examples
✔ When ON: Produce 100 bottles → system creates a new Batch without asking you.
✔ When OFF: You must choose or create the Batch manually before submitting.


⭐ Summary (Very Simple)

ON = ERPNext auto-creates Serial/Batch numbers when finishing Work Order.
OFF = You must create them manually.


note : 
1. To use “Make Serial No / Batch from Work Order”, your item must already be marked as:

   Has Serial No → if the item needs serial numbers
   Has Batch No → if the item needs batch numbers

Otherwise ERPNext cannot create serial or batch numbers automatically.

what happen when you doing this :
1. in production plan we have section "Sub Assembly Items", inside this we have button "Get Sub Assembly Items"
-> after clicking this button it fatches sub asssemblies raw material automatically from main BOM  (erp know which is raw material or sub assemblies )
-> it also fetch other raw materials from Main BOM


2. What happen when you done material req. but create work order
-> it create work order for each sub assemblies or one main workoder for final item
