1. when i create production plan BOM get automated linked then i select get raw materials, raw material will get automatically then how this comes it all inside BOM becuase professior is doesn't tell anything about BOM till now i think he will say but please clear my confusion

Ans.

⚙️ Step 1: BOM (Bill of Materials)
A BOM is the foundation of everything in manufacturing.

It defines:
- The finished item (the product you’ll make)
- The raw materials needed
- The quantities of each raw material

Optional: operations, workstations, and costs


🧩 Step 2: Production Plan → BOM linkage
When you create a Production Plan, you select:
- The items to manufacture
- The quantity to produce
- Optionally, the sales orders to fulfill

When you click “Get Items from BOM”, ERPNext:
- Looks up the default BOM for each production item (from the Item master or you manually select it).
-  Links that BOM to the Production Plan record (in child table Production Plan Item).
- Multiplies the BOM raw materials by the quantity to produce to calculate total material requirements.

Step 3: Get Raw Materials (the magic button)

Step 4: Downstream Effects
- From the Production Plan, you can then:
- Create Material Requests (for purchase/transfer)
- Create Work Orders
- Both will carry forward those raw materials and BOM links.

real workflow :

| Step                      | Action                                  | Where the data comes from                      |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Create BOM                | Define finished product + raw materials | `tabBOM` + `tabBOM Item`                       |
| Create Production Plan    | Link item → default BOM                 | `Production Plan Item` child table             |
| Click "Get Raw Materials" | Pulls from BOM using backend function   | `get_bom_items_as_dict()`                      |
| Materials show up         | Summed + merged list of all RM          | `Production Plan Material Request` child table |

2. Create Material Requests (for purchase/transfer), now after creating material request according to my reason but my quetion is after creating material request for that i must i should/ must create purchase order or not ?


Ans. 

1️⃣ What is a “Material Request” in ERPNext?

A Material Request is just a request document — it doesn’t actually buy or transfer anything yet.
It tells the system what materials you need, how much, and why.



There are different types of Material Requests:

| Type                  | Used For                                        | Typical Source                               |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Purchase**          | You need to *buy* materials from a supplier     | When raw material is not in stock            |
| **Material Transfer** | You need to *move* materials between warehouses | When stock exists in another warehouse       |
| **Manufacture**       | You want to *make* finished goods               | Generated from Production Plan or Work Order |
| **Customer Provided** | Customer supplies materials                     | Used in subcontracting cases                 |



2️⃣ In the Production Plan context

When you click “Create Material Request” from the Production Plan, ERPNext looks at your Stock Availability and automatically decides which type to create.

So if:
- The system finds stock not available, it creates Material Request (Purchase).
- If stock exists in another warehouse, it can create Material Request (Transfer).
- If it’s a make-to-order scenario, it can create Material Request (Manufacture).

3️⃣ When do you need to create a Purchase Order?
| Scenario                                    | Action                                                                                               |
| -----------------------------------------   | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------                  |
| ❌ Raw materials already in same warehouse  | ➤ No **Purchase Order** — directly make **Work Order**  ( directly make work order)                  |
| ⚙️ Stock in another warehouse               | ➤ Create **Material Request (Transfer)** → then **Stock Entry (Material Transfer)**                  |
| ✅ No raw materials in any warehouse        | ➤ Create **Material Request (Purchase)** → convert to **Purchase Order** ( running buying cycle )    |

3. complete cycle with different phase


PHASE 1: PLANNING STAGE (Deciding What to Produce)

Sales Order / Sales Forecast
            ↓
     (Triggers Demand)
            ↓
     Production Plan
            ↓
     Material Request ( here you can do different things like create purchase order, stock entry, sometimes this is no need to do) - read last above table
            ↓
     Creates → Work Orders (for each item/sub-assembly)


🧠 Goal: Figure out what, how much, and when to produce.


PHASE 2: PREPARATION STAGE (Defining the Recipe & Process)

Item (Finished + Raw)
      ↓
Bill of Materials (BOM)
      ↓
Operation → Workstation Type → Workstation
      ↓
Routing (Process Sequence)
      



🧠 Goal: Define what materials are needed and how the item will be made.
Item = Product or material definition
BOM = List of materials required for 1 finished unit
Routing = Step-by-step operations (linked to Workstations)
Operation / Workstation = Who and where the work happens



🔹 PHASE 3: EXECUTION STAGE (Actual Production Happens)

Work Order (Fetches BOM + Routing) - x` you must to creating Bom & Routing first
     ↓
Material Transfer for Manufacture (Stock Entry)
     ↓
(Job Cards auto-created per operation)
     ↓
Job Cards (Operation tracking per Workstation)
     ↓
Stock Entry (Manufacture)
     ↓
(Finishes production) after completing all operation by creating Job card for each opearation


🧠 Goal: Convert raw materials into finished goods.
Work Order = The main manufacturing command
Material Transfer for Manufacture = Moves raw materials to the shop floor
Job Cards = Tracks each operation (Cutting, Welding, etc.)
Stock Entry (Manufacture) = Consumes materials, creates finished goods




🔹 PHASE 4: POST-PRODUCTION STAGE (Finishing, Costing & Inventory) this is optional step.

Work Order (Completed)
      ↓
Work Order Costing
      ↓
(Combines Material + Operation + Overhead Cost)
      ↓
Stock Ledger / GL Entries
      ↓
(Quality Inspection - Optional)
      ↓
Finished Goods Available for Sale


🧠 Goal: Finalize costs, quality, and inventory valuation.

4. To start all thing i must need to create production plan or not ?

⚙️ Let’s Compare Both Approaches


🔹 Option 1: With Production Plan (Large-Scale / Planned Manufacturing)

Use this when:
- You have many Sales Orders or products to plan at once.
- You want to analyze stock and auto-create multiple Work Orders together.
- You need a production manager’s planning view (capacity, deadlines, etc.).
- You do batch production (not just one product at a time).

flow :

Sales Orders / Forecast
      ↓
Production Plan
      ↓
Auto-creates multiple Work Orders
      ↓
Each Work Order → BOM + Routing → Job Cards → Stock Entries




✅ Advantages:
- Great for large factories or make-to-stock manufacturing.
- Automatically handles multiple items.
- Checks material availability before creating Work Orders.
- Reduces manual Work Order creation.

⚠️ Downside:
- Slightly more setup and an extra step before Work Orders.
- Not ideal for small or fast, single-item jobs.



Option 2: Without Production Plan (Simple / On-Demand Manufacturing)

Use this when:
- You’re a small or mid-size setup.
- You only make one or few items at a time.
- You produce on-demand (e.g., based on a single Sales Order).
- You don’t need aggregated planning or MRP logic.

flow :

Sales Order (or manual trigger)
      ↓
Work Order (create directly) including BOM + Routing(it cintain opearations, workstation details)
     ↓
Material Transfer for Manufacture (Stock Entry)
     ↓
Job Cards (per operation)
     ↓
Stock Entry (Manufacture)
     ↓
Work Order Completed


✅ Advantages:
- Fast and simple — fewer steps.
- Great for custom manufacturing or prototyping.
- Easy to control manually.

⚠️ Downside:
- No automatic material shortage visibility across multiple products.
- You have to manage Work Orders individually.


💬 Simple Rule to Remember:
Production Plan = Planning tool (optional)
Work Order = Execution tool (mandatory)
