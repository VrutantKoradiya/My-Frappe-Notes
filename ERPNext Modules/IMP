1. valuation method(item) 
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

- It decides how ERPNext calculates the value (cost) of an item in stock when items are purchased, issued, or sold.

default : FIFO

FIFO (First In, First Out)
- The system assumes that the oldest items (first purchased) are sold or issued first.
- For example: You bought 10 units at ₹100, and then bought another 10 units at ₹120.
- If you sell 10 units, ERPNext will value those issued items at ₹100 each, because the first batch purchased is considered sold first.

MA (Moving Average)
- In this method, each new purchase changes the average rate of the item. The issue rate is always the current average rate.
- For example: You bought 10 units at ₹100, and then bought another 10 units at ₹120.
- The average cost becomes ₹110.
- If you sell 5 units, ERPNext will value those issued items at ₹110 each, which is the moving average rate.

2. learn more about UOM ( Unit of Measure )
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Enabled :
- If checked → this UOM can be used in transactions.
- Helps you disable any unused UOM without deleting it


UOM Name :
- The actual name of the unit (e.g., Nos, Kg, Meter, Box, Litre).
- Defines how quantity is measured across Buying, Selling, and Inventory.

1. is frozen, maintain stock, * selling all settings, Is Reverse Charge, Is Subcontracted, Apply Tax Withholding Amount
2. blanket order, * buying setting, UOM(item), Valuation Method (Item), is customer provided , Allow alternate item, is internal supplier(supplier)

Answers :

A. Is Reverse Charge
->
This checkbox is used when you (the buyer) have to pay GST directly to the government instead of your supplier.
dNormally, the supplier collects GST and pays it to the government.
But under Reverse Charge Mechanism (RCM) — The buyer is responsible for paying GST to the government.

-----------------------------

B. Is Subcontracted
->
- Subcontracting in ERPNext means you send your raw materials or components to an external supplier (subcontractor), and they use those materials to manufacture 
  or assemble a finished product for you.
- So, you own the raw materials, but the subcontractor performs the work (like fabrication, coating, assembly, etc.).

- Subcontracting materials are the raw materials or components that you supply to the subcontractor to make the final product.

-----------------------------

C. Apply Tax Withholding Amount
->
- In ERPNext, the “Apply Tax Withholding Amount” option is used to automatically deduct Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) or Withholding Tax from a transaction
 (like a Purchase Invoice, Payment Entry, or Journal Entry) based on predefined rules.


🧾 What is Tax Withholding?
Tax Withholding (TDS) means that when you pay a supplier (or sometimes receive money from a customer), you deduct a percentage of the amount as tax and pay that to the government instead of paying the full amount to the other party.


Example (India context):
- You pay ₹100,000 to a consultant.
- TDS @10% is applicable.
- You pay ₹90,000 to the consultant and ₹10,000 to the government.
ERPNext should automatically calculate and show that ₹10,000 was withheld.

	
🧮 Effect on Accounting
- Expense (or income) is recorded in full.
- A liability (TDS Payable) is created for the withheld amount.
- Net payable/receivable is reduced by the TDS amount.


-----------------------------


D. is frozen
->
Prevents any new transactions for this supplier

-----------------------------

E. maintain stock
->
- If ✅ checked, ERPNext will track stock quantity and value for this item. If ❌ unchecked, ERPNext treats it as a non-stock item.

| **Situation**                           | **Maintain Stock?** |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Raw Material / Finished Goods           | ✅ Yes               |
| Consumables (tracked inventory)         | ✅ Yes               |
| Labor / Service / Subcontract Charges   | ❌ No                |
| Office Expenses (like Stationery, Rent) | ❌ No                |

Maintain Stock = tells ERPNext whether to track inventory movement for that item or treat it as a non-stock (service/expense) item.

-----------------------------


D. blanket order
->
- Blanket Order is used when a customer or supplier agrees to buy or sell a specific quantity of items over a period of time 
  — but they’ll send actual orders (Sales Orders or Purchase Orders) in parts, not all at once.

- Think of it as a long-term contract between you and your customer (or supplier).

🧾 Example (Sales side)

Suppose a school says: “We’ll buy 100 computers this year, but we’ll order 20 each month.”

You can:
- Create a Blanket Order (Sales) for:
     Customer: The school
     Item: Computer
     Total Quantity: 100
     Rate: $500 each
     Validity Period: Jan–Dec 2025

- Each month, when they confirm, you create a Sales Order for 20 computers.
- ERPNext automatically tracks how many items from the blanket order are fulfilled and how many are remaining.

🔸 Purchase Example
- If you’re buying from a supplier: “We’ll buy 1,000 keyboards this year at $10 each, delivered in batches of 200.”
- You’d create a Blanket Order (Purchase), and later generate Purchase Orders from it.


⚙️ ERPNext Behavior
- Quotation = pricing and negotiation stage
- Blanket Order = commitment stage (optional but helpful for recurring business)
- Sales Order = execution stage (actual delivery + stock reservation)

-----------------------------

E. is customer provided
-> 
- If ✅ checked, it means this item is owned by the customer, not by your company.

- You sometimes receive an item from your customer to repair, process, or modify,
  but it still belongs to the customer — it’s not your company’s stock.

used for - Used in Manufacturing, Service, and Subcontracting when the customer gives raw material or equipment for repair, processing, or assembly.

-----------------------------

F. Allow alternate item
->
- If ✅ checked, ERPNext allows this item to be replaced with another equivalent item in transactions.
- Useful when the exact item is unavailable, and you want to use a substitute item instead

- Sometimes the main item is out of stock, discontinued, or temporarily unavailable. Instead of blocking the order, ERPNext can suggest or allow an alternative item 
 (defined under the same item or linked through “Item Alternative” Doctype).

How works

| **Step** | **What Happens**                                                                                                           |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣       | You tick **Allow Alternative Item** in Item master.                                                                        |
| 2️⃣       | You link related items under **Item Alternative** Doctype.                                                                 |
| 3️⃣       | When that item is used in an order and stock is not available, ERPNext suggests available alternative items automatically. |

-----------------------------

1. 🧾 “Is Return (Credit Note)” — Meaning in ERPNext
- In ERPNext, the checkbox “Is Return (Credit Note)” is used to mark a Sales Invoice (or Purchase Invoice) as a return document 
  — meaning it’s being created to reverse or adjust a previous sale or purchase.
  
🧠 In Simple Terms: ✅ Tick this box when the customer is returning items and you need to issue a credit note (a negative invoice).

📦 Example Scenario
Let’s say you sold 10 laptops to a customer and created a Sales Invoice (SI-0001) for ₹100,000.
A few days later, the customer returns 2 defective laptops.

Here’s what you do:
- Create a new Sales Invoice.
- Tick “Is Return (Credit Note)”.
- In the Return Against field, link it to the original Sales Invoice (SI-0001).
- Add the 2 laptops as items with the same rate and taxes.
- Save and submit the invoice.

ERPNext will automatically:
- Create a negative stock movement (if perpetual inventory is enabled).
- Adjust the customer’s outstanding balance (reduce receivables).
- Generate an accounting entry that reverses the original sale for those 2 laptops.

----------------------

2. Is Rate Adjustment Entry (Debit Note)
- In ERPNext, the checkbox “Is Rate Adjustment Entry (Debit Note)” is used when you need to issue a Debit Note 
  — not because of returned items, but because of a rate correction (price difference) after the original invoice was submitted.
  
🧠 In Simple Terms: ✅ Tick “Is Rate Adjustment Entry (Debit Note)” when the rate (price) in the original invoice was incorrect,
                       nd you need to adjust the value — without affecting the quantity or stock movement.
                       
🔍 Example Scenario

Let’s say you created a Sales Invoice for: 10 Laptops @ ₹50,000 each = ₹5,00,000
Later, you realize the correct rate should have been ₹55,000.
Now you need to increase the invoice amount by ₹50,000 (difference for 10 laptops × ₹5,000).

Here’s how you handle it:
- Create a new Sales Invoice.
- Tick “Is Rate Adjustment Entry (Debit Note)”.
- Link it to the original invoice in the Return Against field.
- Add the same items — but only for the rate difference (not quantity).
- Save and submit.

----------------------

4. valuation rate in Item
->

It is the default cost ERPNext uses to calculate stock value when no other valuation data exists.



✅ Where is Valuation Rate used?

ERPNext uses the valuation rate for:

1. Opening stock entries
- When you create an Opening Stock Entry, ERPNext takes valuation rate × quantity to calculate opening stock value.

2. First purchase or manufacturing entry
- If no purchase history exists, the system uses the valuation rate.

3. Stock Ledger Valuation
- It is used in FIFO, Average, or Moving Average costing to compute the value of inventory.

4. Stock Reconciliation
- If a reconciliation is done without entering a rate, valuation rate is applied.



📌 Important note

Valuation rate in the Item master is not always the actual stock valuation.
Once your system has transactions, ERPNext starts calculating valuation rate automatically based on:
Purchase Receipt rates
Stock entries
Manufacturing cost
Additional costs (Landed Cost Voucher)

So the Item’s valuation rate is mostly used: 👉 Only as a starting value, not the ongoing valuation.



🎯 Example

If Item X has valuation rate = 100 INR
And you add opening stock of 10 qty:

Stock Value = 10 × 100 = 1000 INR

Later if you purchase at 120, the valuation rate will be updated automatically.

in short,
Valuation Rate = Default cost of the item used to calculate inventory value until real transactions set the cost.
