:) ERPNext allows custom workflows, approval levels, and auto-updates stock values from purchase entries.


@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Buying Cycle :

1️⃣ Material Request
- This is the starting point of the buying process.
→ When any department needs an item, they create this request.
  (We need to buy something.)



2️⃣ Request for Quotation (RFQ)
- Once you know what you need, you ask multiple suppliers for their price offers.
- The RFQ is sent to all suppliers registered in the system.
→ Send this to suppliers asking for prices.
  (Ask suppliers – “How much will you charge?”)

ex: RFQ sent to 3 suppliers: HP Dealer, Dell Dealer, and Lenovo Dealer.



3️⃣ Supplier Quotation
- Suppliers reply with their quotation — including price, delivery time, and terms.
- You compare the quotations and choose the best offer.
→ Supplier replies with prices and terms.
  (Supplier says – “My rate is ₹___ per item.”)

ex: HP Dealer offers ₹50,000 per laptop — best deal → chosen supplier.


4️⃣ Purchase Order (PO)
- Once the supplier is finalized, you issue a Purchase Order.
- This is the official confirmation that you’re buying items from that supplier.
- The supplier will now start preparing to deliver the goods.
→ You confirm the order with the selected supplier.
  (Okay, we’ll buy from you.)

ex: You send a PO to HP Dealer for 10 laptops at ₹50,000 each.



5️⃣ Payment Entry (Advance) (optional)
- Sometimes, suppliers ask for an advance payment before delivery.
- In that case, you can create an Advance Payment Entry linked to the PO.
→ If supplier needs advance payment before delivery.
  (Pay some amount before getting goods.)

ex: You pay 20% advance to HP Dealer before shipping.



6️⃣ Purchase Receipt
- When the goods are delivered, you record a Purchase Receipt.
- It confirms that items have been received and added to stock (Inventory).
- Stock levels are updated automatically.
- actual stock entry (in this phase our stock & accounting gets impact)
→ When items arrive, record that you’ve received them.
  (Goods received and added to stock.)

ex: You receive 10 laptops → Stock increases by 10 units.



7️⃣ Quality Inspection (optional)
- If your company has a quality process, you can inspect items before final acceptance.
- The result (Pass/Fail) is recorded here.
→ Check product quality if required.
  (Check if items are okay or damaged.)

ex: 2 laptops had screen issues → marked as “Failed” in Quality Inspection.



8️⃣ Purchase Invoice
- Once goods are received and verified, you get a supplier invoice (bill).
- You record this as a Purchase Invoice, which creates a payable entry in Accounts.
→ Supplier sends bill → record it here.
  (Record supplier’s invoice for payment.)
  
ex: Invoice #HP123 – ₹5,00,000 created against the PO.


9️⃣ Payment Entry
- Finally, you create a Payment Entry to mark the invoice as paid.
- It reduces your Accounts Payable and updates your bank balance.
→ Make final payment and close the purchase.
  (Pay supplier and finish the cycle.)

ex: Paid ₹5,00,000 to HP Dealer → Payment Entry marked as “Completed”.

  or assemble a finished product for you.
- So, you own the raw materials, but the subcontractor performs the work (like fabrication, coating, assembly, etc.).

- Subcontracting materials are the raw materials or components that you supply to the subcontractor to make the final product.

“Apply Tax Withholding Amount” :
- In ERPNext, the “Apply Tax Withholding Amount” option is used to automatically deduct Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) or Withholding Tax from a transaction
 (like a Purchase Invoice, Payment Entry, or Journal Entry) based on predefined rules.


🧾 What is Tax Withholding?
Tax Withholding (TDS) means that when you pay a supplier (or sometimes receive money from a customer), you deduct a percentage of the amount as tax and pay that to the government instead of paying the full amount to the other party.


Example (India context):
- You pay ₹100,000 to a consultant.
- TDS @10% is applicable.
- You pay ₹90,000 to the consultant and ₹10,000 to the government.
ERPNext should automatically calculate and show that ₹10,000 was withheld.

	
🧮 Effect on Accounting
- Expense (or income) is recorded in full.
- A liability (TDS Payable) is created for the withheld amount.
- Net payable/receivable is reduced by the TDS amount.

here,

Allow Alternative Item :
- If ✅ checked, ERPNext allows this item to be replaced with another equivalent item in transactions.
- Useful when the exact item is unavailable, and you want to use a substitute item instead

- Sometimes the main item is out of stock, discontinued, or temporarily unavailable. Instead of blocking the order, ERPNext can suggest or allow an alternative item 
 (defined under the same item or linked through “Item Alternative” Doctype).

How works

| **Step** | **What Happens**                                                                                                           |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣      | You tick **Allow Alternative Item** in Item master.                                                                        |
| 2️⃣      | You link related items under **Item Alternative** Doctype.                                                                 |
| 3️⃣      | When that item is used in an order and stock is not available, ERPNext suggests available alternative items automatically. |

-------

Maintain Stock:
- If ✅ checked, ERPNext will track stock quantity and value for this item. If ❌ unchecked, ERPNext treats it as a non-stock item.

| **Situation**                           | **Maintain Stock?** |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Raw Material / Finished Goods           | ✅ Yes               |
| Consumables (tracked inventory)         | ✅ Yes               |
| Labor / Service / Subcontract Charges   | ❌ No                |
| Office Expenses (like Stationery, Rent) | ❌ No                |

Maintain Stock = tells ERPNext whether to track inventory movement for that item or treat it as a non-stock (service/expense) item.

HSN and SAC are classification codes used in GST (Goods and Services Tax) systems — primarily in India, but ERPNext supports them globally for tax compliance.

| Code Type | Full Form                         | Applies To           | Purpose                                                 |
| --------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **HSN**   | Harmonized System of Nomenclature | **Goods / Products** | Used to classify goods for GST and international trade. |
| **SAC**   | Services Accounting Code          | **Services**         | Used to classify services for GST and taxation.         |

-------

A Fixed Asset in ERPNext (and in accounting generally) is:
- If ✅ checked, ERPNext treats this item as a Fixed Asset instead of inventory.
- A tangible or intangible item that your company owns, uses for operations, and expects to use for more than one accounting period.

Examples:
- Computers, furniture, vehicles, machinery — tangible assets
- Patents, software licenses — intangible assets

This tells ERPNext that the item you are buying is not meant for resale or consumption, but is a company asset — like furniture, computers, machinery, etc.

- So instead of tracking it as stock, ERPNext will create an Asset record after you buy it.

| **Item Tax Table**                     | Define tax template, rate, and category. |

Input Tax Credit (ITC) in GST?
Input Tax Credit (ITC) means you can claim credit for the GST you paid on purchases (inputs, goods, or services) that are used in your business.

For example:
- You buy goods worth ₹10,000 + 18% GST = ₹1,800
- You can claim ₹1,800 as input tax credit, reducing your GST payable on sales.

Ineligible for Input Tax Credit” Mean?
- Some purchases are not allowed to be claimed as input tax credit under GST rules.
- If a purchase is ineligible, you cannot use that GST amount to offset your output tax liability.

- means if ITC applied then when you buy something then you pay GST( e.g. 1800 rs.), after that when you sell that product you get that GST from your buyer, so now you get 1800 
  so here only one person pay GST to gevernment.( if you sell then you get your paid gst then it consider your buyer pays gst)

- but if you ineligible for that so you only pays GST after that when you sell you not get any GST for your recovery ....
  
| Type of Expense                         | ITC Allowed? | Reason                   |

  that affects how ERPNext auto-suggests quantities based on existing data.

When ERPNext tries to suggest a quantity (e.g., in a Material Request or Stock Entry), it compares the suggested quantity with the actual requirement.
- If the difference is within the threshold → ERPNext shows the suggestion.
- If the difference is beyond the threshold → ERPNext does not auto-suggest (to avoid large errors).
