1. when i create production plan BOM get automated linked then i select get raw materials raw material will get automatically then how this comes it all inside BOM becuase professior is doesn't tell anything about BOM till now i think he will say but please clear my confusion

Ans.

⚙️ Step 1: BOM (Bill of Materials)
A BOM is the foundation of everything in manufacturing.

It defines:
- The finished item (the product you’ll make)
- The raw materials needed
- The quantities of each raw material

Optional: operations, workstations, and costs


🧩 Step 2: Production Plan → BOM linkage
When you create a Production Plan, you select:
- The items to manufacture
- The quantity to produce
- Optionally, the sales orders to fulfill

When you click “Get Items from BOM”, ERPNext:
- Looks up the default BOM for each production item (from the Item master or you manually select it).
-  Links that BOM to the Production Plan record (in child table Production Plan Item).
- Multiplies the BOM raw materials by the quantity to produce to calculate total material requirements.

Step 3: Get Raw Materials (the magic button)

Step 4: Downstream Effects
- From the Production Plan, you can then:
- Create Material Requests (for purchase/transfer)
- Create Work Orders
- Both will carry forward those raw materials and BOM links.

real workflow :

| Step                      | Action                                  | Where the data comes from                      |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Create BOM                | Define finished product + raw materials | `tabBOM` + `tabBOM Item`                       |
| Create Production Plan    | Link item → default BOM                 | `Production Plan Item` child table             |
| Click "Get Raw Materials" | Pulls from BOM using backend function   | `get_bom_items_as_dict()`                      |
| Materials show up         | Summed + merged list of all RM          | `Production Plan Material Request` child table |

Create Material Requests (for purchase/transfer), now after creating material request according to my reason but my quetion is after creating material request for that i must i should/ must create purchase order or not ?

1️⃣ What is a “Material Request” in ERPNext?

A Material Request is just a request document — it doesn’t actually buy or transfer anything yet.
It tells the system what materials you need, how much, and why.



There are different types of Material Requests:

| Type                  | Used For                                        | Typical Source                               |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Purchase**          | You need to *buy* materials from a supplier     | When raw material is not in stock            |
| **Material Transfer** | You need to *move* materials between warehouses | When stock exists in another warehouse       |
| **Manufacture**       | You want to *make* finished goods               | Generated from Production Plan or Work Order |
| **Customer Provided** | Customer supplies materials                     | Used in subcontracting cases                 |



2️⃣ In the Production Plan context

When you click “Create Material Request” from the Production Plan, ERPNext looks at your Stock Availability and automatically decides which type to create.

So if:
- The system finds stock not available, it creates Material Request (Purchase).
- If stock exists in another warehouse, it can create Material Request (Transfer).
- If it’s a make-to-order scenario, it can create Material Request (Manufacture).

3️⃣ When do you need to create a Purchase Order?
| Scenario                                  | Action                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ❌ Raw materials already in same warehouse | ➤ No **Purchase Order** — directly make **Work Order** or **Transfer** if needed    |
| ⚙️ Stock in another warehouse             | ➤ Create **Material Request (Transfer)** → then **Stock Entry (Material Transfer)** |
| ✅ No raw materials in any warehouse       | ➤ Create **Material Request (Purchase)** → convert to **Purchase Order**            |
