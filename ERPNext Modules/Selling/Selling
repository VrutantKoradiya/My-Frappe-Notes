| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Le.**               | A school principal calls your company asking, “Do you sell computers for labs?” You record this person as a lead.                                    |
| **Opp.**              | You talk to them more and find out they want 20 computers next month. You create an opportunity — the deal has a good chance of happening.           |
| **Quo.**              | The principal asks for prices. You make a quotation — it includes items, price, tax, and delivery time. You email it to them.                        |
| **Bl. Ord. (opt.)**   | The school says, “We’ll buy 100 computers this year but order 20 each month.” You create a blanket order to fix the long-term agreement.             |
| **SO**                | After a few days, the school confirms: “Yes, send 20 computers as per quotation.” You convert the quotation to a sales order. Stock is now reserved. |
| **Pay. (Adv.)**       | The school pays 50% in advance. You record this as an advance payment entry linked to the sales order.                                               |
| **DN**                | Your warehouse packs and sends 20 computers to the school. You create a delivery note — stock quantity reduces automatically.                        |
| **Pack. Slip (opt.)** | Your logistics team prints a packing slip that lists what’s inside each box — useful for large shipments.                                            |
| **SI**                | Once items are delivered, you create a sales invoice — the legal document asking for remaining payment.                                              |
| **Pay. (Final)**      | The school pays the remaining 50%. You record this as a payment entry. The invoice is marked as paid.                                                |

  → Opportunity {
      → Quotation {
          → Sales Order {

here,
- blanket order is optional main cycle is from Lead

other :


1. Blanket Order : 
- Blanket Order is used when a customer or supplier agrees to buy or sell a specific quantity of items over a period of time 
  — but they’ll send actual orders (Sales Orders or Purchase Orders) in parts, not all at once.

- Think of it as a long-term contract between you and your customer (or supplier).

🧾 Example (Sales side)

Suppose a school says: “We’ll buy 100 computers this year, but we’ll order 20 each month.”

You can:
- Create a Blanket Order (Sales) for:
     Customer: The school
     Item: Computer
     Total Quantity: 100
     Rate: $500 each
     Validity Period: Jan–Dec 2025

- Each month, when they confirm, you create a Sales Order for 20 computers.
- ERPNext automatically tracks how many items from the blanket order are fulfilled and how many are remaining.

🔸 Purchase Example
- If you’re buying from a supplier: “We’ll buy 1,000 keyboards this year at $10 each, delivered in batches of 200.”
- You’d create a Blanket Order (Purchase), and later generate Purchase Orders from it.


⚙️ ERPNext Behavior
- Quotation = pricing and negotiation stage
- Blanket Order = commitment stage (optional but helpful for recurring business)
- Sales Order = execution stage (actual delivery + stock reservation)


🚫 Common Mistake
“Should I enter only 20 computers in the Blanket Order?”
❌ No —
- A Blanket Order should reflect the total committed quantity (100 in your case).
- The Sales Orders you create later (20 each) are the actual partial orders linked to it.

ERPNext automatically reduces the “remaining quantity” after each Sales Order.


flow :

Seller → creates → Lead → for Potential Customer
Seller → converts → Lead → to Opportunity
Seller → sends → Quotation → to Customer
Customer → confirms → Quotation
Seller → creates → Sales Order → for Customer
Customer → makes (optional) → Advance Payment
Seller → delivers → Goods → via Delivery Note
Seller → (optional) → creates → Packing Slip
Seller → sends → Sales Invoice → to Customer
Customer → makes → Final Payment Entry

1. 🧾 “Is Return (Credit Note)” — Meaning in ERPNext
- In ERPNext, the checkbox “Is Return (Credit Note)” is used to mark a Sales Invoice (or Purchase Invoice) as a return document 
  — meaning it’s being created to reverse or adjust a previous sale or purchase.
  
🧠 In Simple Terms: ✅ Tick this box when the customer is returning items and you need to issue a credit note (a negative invoice).

📦 Example Scenario
Let’s say you sold 10 laptops to a customer and created a Sales Invoice (SI-0001) for ₹100,000.
A few days later, the customer returns 2 defective laptops.

Here’s what you do:
- Create a new Sales Invoice.
- Tick “Is Return (Credit Note)”.
- In the Return Against field, link it to the original Sales Invoice (SI-0001).
- Add the 2 laptops as items with the same rate and taxes.
- Save and submit the invoice.

ERPNext will automatically:
- Create a negative stock movement (if perpetual inventory is enabled).
- Adjust the customer’s outstanding balance (reduce receivables).
- Generate an accounting entry that reverses the original sale for those 2 laptops.

----------------------

2. Is Rate Adjustment Entry (Debit Note)
- In ERPNext, the checkbox “Is Rate Adjustment Entry (Debit Note)” is used when you need to issue a Debit Note 
  — not because of returned items, but because of a rate correction (price difference) after the original invoice was submitted.
  
🧠 In Simple Terms: ✅ Tick “Is Rate Adjustment Entry (Debit Note)” when the rate (price) in the original invoice was incorrect,
                       nd you need to adjust the value — without affecting the quantity or stock movement.
                       
🔍 Example Scenario

Let’s say you created a Sales Invoice for: 10 Laptops @ ₹50,000 each = ₹5,00,000
Later, you realize the correct rate should have been ₹55,000.
Now you need to increase the invoice amount by ₹50,000 (difference for 10 laptops × ₹5,000).

Here’s how you handle it:
- Create a new Sales Invoice.
- Tick “Is Rate Adjustment Entry (Debit Note)”.
- Link it to the original invoice in the Return Against field.
- Add the same items — but only for the rate difference (not quantity).
- Save and submit.

|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Default Price List                                  | Default price list for all selling transactions (e.g., Standard Selling).    |
| Maintain Same Rate Throughout Sales Cycle           | Keeps same item rate from Quotation → Invoice (prevents manual rate change). |
| Allow User to Edit Price List Rate in Transactions  | Lets users manually change item rates in documents.                         |
| Validate Selling Price Against Purchase/Valuation   | Prevents selling below cost price to avoid losses.                          |
| Calculate Product Bundle Price (Child Item Rates)   | Calculates bundle price based on prices of its child items.                 |
| Allow Negative Rates for Items                      | Allows entry of negative rates (used for special discounts or returns).      |

here,
1. Allow User to Edit Price List Rate in Transactions 
ex. 

| Item     | Price |
| -------- | ----- |
| ITEM-001 | ₹100  |

Now, in a Sales Order:
- If the checkbox is unchecked, the rate will stay ₹100 — can’t be changed.
- If the checkbox is checked, the user can modify it to ₹95 or ₹110 as needed.

----------

2. Validate Selling Price Against Purchase/Valuation
- This option ensures that the selling price (Rate in transactions like Sales Order, Sales Invoice, etc.) is not lower than your purchase or valuation rate.

----------

3.Calculate Product Bundle Price (Child Item Rates)
- This setting decides how ERPNext calculates the total price of a Product Bundle in your selling transactions (Quotation, Sales Order, Sales Invoice, etc.).

A Product Bundle = A main (parent) item + multiple child items.
Example:
👉 “Desktop Computer Set” = CPU, Monitor, Keyboard, Mouse

Parent Item: Desktop Computer Set
Child Items: CPU, Monitor, Keyboard, Mouse


so, When This Checkbox is Unchecked (Default)
The price of the bundle is taken from the parent item’s price (the Product Bundle item itself).

| Item                 | Type   | Rate    | Used For Calculation |
| -------------------- | ------ | ------- | -------------------- |
| Desktop Computer Set | Parent | ₹50,000 | ✅ Taken              |
| CPU                  | Child  | ₹20,000 | ❌ Ignored            |
| Monitor              | Child  | ₹15,000 | ❌ Ignored            |
| Keyboard             | Child  | ₹5,000  | ❌ Ignored            |
| Mouse                | Child  | ₹2,000  | ❌ Ignored            |

Total = ₹50,000 (from parent)

⚙️ When This Checkbox is Checked (Enabled)
- ERPNext calculates the price of the Product Bundle based on the total of all child item rates instead of the parent item’s rate.

| Item                 | Type   | Rate    | Used For Calculation |
| -------------------- | ------ | ------- | -------------------- |
| Desktop Computer Set | Parent | ₹0      | ❌ Ignored            |
| CPU                  | Child  | ₹20,000 | ✅ Included           |
| Monitor              | Child  | ₹15,000 | ✅ Included           |
| Keyboard             | Child  | ₹5,000  | ✅ Included           |
| Mouse                | Child  | ₹2,000  | ✅ Included           |

Total = ₹42,000 (sum of child items)

----------

4. Allow Negative Rates for Items
- This setting controls whether you can enter a negative rate (i.e., a rate < 0) in sales transactions (like Sales Order, Sales Invoice, Delivery Note, etc.).

- ERPNext normally doesn’t allow negative rates, because that would mean you’re selling an item and paying the customer — which is usually a mistake.
- But in some special use cases, it’s intentionally required.

ex.
| Item      | Qty | Rate | Explanation                                           |
| --------- | --- | ---- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Product A | 1   | 500  | Normal sale                                           |
| Product A | 1   | -500 | Negative rate — e.g., return, discount, or adjustment |

⚙️ When Checkbox is Unchecked (Default)
- Negative rate is not allowed.
- If you try to enter one, ERPNext throws validation like: “Rate cannot be negative for item X.”


⚙️ When Checkbox is Checked (Enabled)
- System allows you to enter negative rates freely.
- Mostly used for:
   Credit adjustments
   Promotional discounts (item-wise instead of total)
   Return transactions
   Reverse entries

Other :

1. Don’t Reserve Sales Order Qty on Sales Return” in ERPNext

🧩 Example
Scenario:
- You have a Sales Order for 10 units.
- You delivered 10 units (Sales Order fully delivered).
- Customer returns 2 units (Sales Return created).

Now, depending on the checkbox:

| Checkbox Status | Effect on Sales Order       | Explanation                                                                                      |
| --------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ❌ **Unchecked** | Reserved qty increases by 2 | ERPNext assumes you might re-deliver those 2 units, so it “reopens” part of the Sales Order.     |
| ✅ **Checked**   | No change in reserved qty   | ERPNext treats the return as a final reversal — it won’t plan to re-deliver those 2 items again. |



🧠 When to Check This Option

Check this if:
- You don’t want to re-open or re-reserve Sales Orders when items are returned.
- Your business treats returns as final and manages replacements as new orders.

Leave it unchecked if:
- You want to allow re-delivery from the same Sales Order after a return (common in replacement workflows).

| Loyalty Program                | Assigns customer to a specific loyalty program.                       |



here,

1. Credit Limit = how much a customer can buy on credit (without paying yet).

Think of it like this:
- You (the company) sell items to your customer, but they don’t pay immediately — they’ll pay later.
- To avoid risk, you set a limit (a “credit limit”) for how much they can buy without paying.
- Once their unpaid total reaches that limit, ERPNext will stop new sales orders or invoices for that customer (depending on your settings) until they pay some amount.


👉 Example:
You set a customer’s credit limit to ₹10,000.

- They buy items worth ₹6,000 — okay.
- They buy more worth ₹4,000 — total ₹10,000, still okay.
- They try to buy ₹2,000 more — ERPNext will warn or block it because they’ve hit the limit.

now what is Bypass Credit Limit Check at Sales Order ?
-> When this box is checked, ERPNext will ignore the customer’s credit limit when creating a Sales Order.


Normally, ERPNext checks if the customer’s total unpaid amount has crossed their credit limit.
- If it’s crossed, ERPNext would stop you from making a new Sales Order.

- But if you tick “Bypass Credit Limit Check at Sales Order”, ERPNext will not stop or warn you — it will allow you to make the Sales Order anyway.

💡 Example:
- Customer credit limit = ₹10,000
- Customer already owes ₹9,500
- You make a new Sales Order of ₹2,000

Normally → ERPNext will block it (because ₹9,500 + ₹2,000 = ₹11,500 > ₹10,000)
If “Bypass Credit Limit Check at Sales Order” is ticked → ERPNext will allow it

2. Default Accounts

| Field                          | Meaning                                                                         |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Company**                    | The company this setting applies to                                             |
| **Default Receivable Account** | The account where this customer’s unpaid invoices (money they owe) are recorded |


Example

| Company     | Default Receivable Account |
| ----------- | -------------------------- |
| ABC Pvt Ltd | Debtors - ABC              |
| XYZ LLP     | Debtors - XYZ              |

Then:
- When you make a Sales Invoice for this customer under ABC Pvt Ltd, ERPNext will automatically post it to Debtors - ABC.
- When you make it under XYZ LLP, it will use Debtors - XYZ.


----------

3. what is Loyalty Program ?

A Loyalty Program is a system that gives reward points to customers when they buy things —
and then lets them use those points to get discounts on future purchases.

💡 Example
- Let’s say you set up a Loyalty Program like this:
- For every ₹100 spent, the customer gets 1 point.
- Every 1 point = ₹1 discount.

Now:
- A customer buys for ₹500 → gets 5 points.
- Next time, they buy again for ₹200 and use 5 points → they get ₹5 off.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
| Field Name   | Description                                                                 |

| Laptop Bag      | 1   | Nos | HP Branded Bag     |
| Wireless Mouse  | 1   | Nos | Logitech Mouse     |

So, when you sell *“Laptop Combo Offer”*, ERPNext automatically deducts 1 Laptop, 1 Bag, and 1 Mouse from stock.


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📖 ABOUT PRODUCT BUNDLE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Product Bundle = Aggregate group of *Items* under one *Parent Item*.

- Useful when you want to sell a package but maintain stock of each individual item.  
- ERPNext does not track stock for the bundle itself — only for the items inside it.  
- When a Sales Invoice is made for the bundle → system automatically pulls and reduces stock for its components.

🧩 Important System Behavior:
| Field                | Value  | Meaning                                         |
|-----------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------|
| Is Stock Item         | No     | The bundle itself is not a stock item.         |
| Is Sales Item         | Yes    | The bundle can be sold as a single product.    |


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
💡 PRACTICAL EXAMPLE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Let’s say your company sells:
- Laptop (₹50,000)
- Laptop Bag (₹1,000)
- Mouse (₹500)

You want to create a combo called **“Laptop Combo Offer”** for ₹51,000.  

**Setup:**
- Create a new Item: “Laptop Combo Offer”  
  → Set *Is Stock Item = No*, *Is Sales Item = Yes*.  
- Go to Product Bundle:  
  → Parent Item = “Laptop Combo Offer”  
  → Add 3 items: Laptop (1), Laptop Bag (1), Mouse (1)

Now, when you create a **Sales Invoice** for “Laptop Combo Offer” →  
ERPNext automatically lists the child items (Laptop, Bag, Mouse) and deducts stock for them individually.



━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ SUMMARY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Product Bundle helps you:
- Sell multiple items as one combined package.  
- Maintain stock of individual components, not the bundle.  
- Offer combo deals or promotional sets easily.  
- Simplify sales process by grouping products under one main item.

📈 Example Workflow:
1️⃣ Create individual items → Laptop, Bag, Mouse.  
2️⃣ Create a non-stock sales item → “Laptop Combo Offer”.  
3️⃣ Use Product Bundle to link all three items.  
4️⃣ Add “Laptop Combo Offer” in Sales Invoice.  
→ ERPNext automatically fetches and updates stock of the 3 child items.
