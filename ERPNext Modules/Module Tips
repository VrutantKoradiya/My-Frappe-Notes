step-2 
understading fields of master doctype of  buying + also doing practical of that master doctype by creating records


what i dont need to do means i need to just look out :
1. settings category -> all( but buying setting need to do ... ) , dont need to lookout if time have then just look out

- prduction section : full 
- Bill of Materials:  all ( routing not need to do )
- reports ( just look out )
- settings
- Tools ( just look out )

practical implementation  : 
note :
1. create work order form production plan /done

WORK ORDER :
1. option SKIP MATERIAL TRASFTER TO WIP / done
2. TWO PRACTICAL
  -  1 FOR MATERIAL REQUEST, 1 FOR SALES ORDER IN WORK ORDER. / done
3. they say ensure some Cost rate  while doing practical / may be done


4. another practical for sub-assembalies .... 










very important : after done learn all fields(all doctype), do practical for all docype not just an cycle ...  
               : creating one chat for all module or ask them for practical implementation of each all doctypes also include Its cycle doctype. or  
                 i need to know for all each doctype ( like technical question, some scenario ...  )... 







	


other important tip :
- for cycle first preferece to ERPNext video(in that they show cycle)
  https://school.frappe.io/lms/courses/erpnext-training/learn/4-1 
- i think we dont need to read documentation
