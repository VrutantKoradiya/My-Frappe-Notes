### Version Control System?

- Version control, also known as source control, is tracking and managing software code changes.

Famous VCS:

-  Git (Most Famous)
- Apache SubVersion
- Piper (Used by Google)


NOTE - GitHub is not VCS.

STEP - 1 install git in our local machine
- you need to install git from official website


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


STEP - 2  Setting up Git Global Configuration
1. set a name that is identifiable for version control

sy: git config --global user.name “[firstname lastname]”
ex: git config --global user.name "Vritant Koradiya”


2. set an email address that will be associated with each history marker

sy: git config --global user.email “[valid-email]”
ex: git config --global user.email “vrutant@gmail.com”

other :

git config --global user.name -> for checing name configuration
git config --global user.email -> for checing email configuration


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


STEP - 3 Setup & Init
1. open the directory you want to working as a Vesrion Control.


2. for start to tracking your version control or Adding Files to VCS
   do/write, 
   
   git init 

- repository = Project
- after that git is Enable for that directory, now we can track changes
- in file U means - untracked


3. for tracking enable,
   do/write, 
   
   git add filename.extension  ex. git add index.js
                        or
   git add .    -> for all file

other:
git diff -> show what added or removed, means show changes
git rm <FILE_PATH> -> Removing Files from Version Control


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


STEP - 4  Commit
what is ?



- whenever we changes in our code we generally need to do commit

sy: git commit -m "Your message"
ex: git commit -m "this is an initial setup"

other :
git log -> we can see our all commits history
git log --oneline   -> short form on oneline of all commits history.
git show commit_unique_id  -> what changes is done in that commit  
     ex. git show 6ac75a2
     
git blame file_name.ext/FILE_PATH  -> showing whole code with who changes including commit SHA, name, time
git status - show modified file


- every commit has an unique id (unique id called = SHA )

NOTE: 
- also make sure commits are always clean, which helps you to do better Version Control
  like dont do whole code in one single commit do like work one one functionality then do commit same for other functionality      

---------------------

Staging Area ?
when you change something after last commit then staging area will be empty, if you try to commit new changes then nothing happen because
staging area is still empty, for adding all new changes in staging area we use git add . 

how to add our files in staging area
1. git add . or git add file_name.ext/FILE_PATH
2. after that we can perform out commit


so folw is, change(modified) something -> enter in staging area using git add -> commit 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

STEP - 5  Reverting Back
- if our new changes(which is commited) is not good or throw error so we can revert back to specific comit again

for example our commit is A,B,C now c is thor error so we need to revert back to specific commit

- HEAD -> last/latest commit
- base node -> first commit

1. transfer you HEAD to specific commit
command-> git reset --hard commit_unique_id/SHA

disadvantage: 
- if we do then our other comit(which throught error) 
  for example A,B,C,D,E,F then we change our HEAD to C then we will loose D,E,F 
  
  
  
  
2. revert particular commit:
   for example A,B,C,D,E,F then F is through error so we only revert F, means if in F commit we write mul = 0 * 10 so it throw error so when we apply this rule 
   F commit are reverting back means mul = 0 * 10 will revert(remove) because we add this code
   
inshort - if you add something and revert them then i will remove ( ulta ho jayega )
in gujrati - je commit hoy enu ultu kari nakhe
                   - if you remove something in that commit then - this will add which you remove ( remove -> add )
                   - if you add something in that commit then - this will remove what you add. ( add- remove )

command->  git revert commit_unique_id/SHA  
note : after using this you need to do again commit steps (like git add . -> git commit -m "message")

here git basic is completed

GitHub & Other :


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Collaboration?
-> to work with team here comes collaboration
-> we need one centrel server to perform collboration 

centrel server, git server = GitHub

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Setup a Git Server:

step - 1. github.com -> Repositories -> give Name, public/private(where in public everyone can access or in private only other user can see which you give an access) 

what git init does?
-> it creates reposotory in our local machine not in github

step - 2. after creating that repository have one link(which is automaticall generate when you create repo.) like git@github.com:VrutantKoradiya/gym_management_system.git

1.now we need to tell our system's GIT to sync our local machine code to that Respository
  comand-> git remote add unique_name link_of_repo  (by default we generally use unique name -> origin )
  ex-> git remote add origin git@github.com:VrutantKoradiya/gym_management_system.git


other:
- git remote -v -> get list of all remotes
- where can we find repo link : in "<> Code" button

2. now we can push our all commit/changes to remote
command: git push -u servername branchname 
ex: git push -u origin main

- now all commits & codes are available in UI(github)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Branching(important)?
-> single track(railway track) - in this track commits are run

ex, main branch has - A,B,C,D,E,F commits

why important:
here if you work on collabroation then you must to working on different branch

for ex Y & Z user is doing collab then both need to work on the different branch,
after completeing work we can merge our all changes to main branch
here what happn if we have y user(branch: y) , z user(branch: z), for example y has 5 commit & z has 3 commit so when we merge this branch to main branch it create single commit for each branch 

what happen when we merger?
- 1 commit created(for y branch) or 1 commit created(for z branch)
  then we can continue to the meain branch  

why imp?
- because if y&z woring on main branch y has 5 commit, z has 3 commit if there is a requirement to revrting y commit then it is very bullshit to revert all commit line by line,
  so here branching comes, after merge we need to revert only one commit(in main branch) which is created when we merge Y user branch(so what happen - we revert only one main commit 
  but it revert Y's all commit)
  
 
how to create branch - 
1. git branch -b <branch_name>


how to push?
- git push --set-upstream origin branch_name (dont need to remember when you do git push(if you working on that new branch) it suggest this command)

how to merge?
1. from UI
Pull Request -> New -> base:main <- compare:your_branch

this changes is done on server not an local machine
so what to do now : checkout to main branhc -> git pull  


2. From CLI
checkout to main branch -> then run git merge servername/branchname -> git push
                                ex: git merge origin/Y    here y is branch name 


working flow: 
1. git branch -b "branch_name" -> git checkout  -> some changes  -> git add . -> git commit -> git push(chages is done on that new branch)

other:
git branch - list of all branch or highlight current working branch
git checkout <branch_name>- switch to specific branch

git checkout -b "branch_name" -  combination of branch creation or checout


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

normally we use merge:
- we can't revert particular commit of Y branch because when we merge branch, it create 1 commit to main which containing all Y branch commit,so we can revert all commits of Y
  branch

but we can use merge & rebase while doing branching flow
- so rebasing is transfer all Y branch commit to Main branch so we can revert particular Y branch's commit

command: git rebase branch_name
ex: git rebase Y (not write main)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stashing ?
generally when you do some changes in you locak machine & someone also change something on remote server, you now if you do git pull then it throw error like 
"you cant pull because you have some unstages changes" now we can do this git add . but we dont want to make those local changes in tracking so here stash comes

flow :

changes in remote or changes in local -> git stash(move you local changes in other directory) -> git pull(geting remote changes) -> git stash apply(get back local changes)

so after that you can pull remote changes without adding your changes in staging area or get those local changes back by git stash apply








my question to ask to chatgpt
1. what is U,A,M in file while using git
2. what is commit ? in simple & shoert description
3. how to use multiple remotes/origins
4. SSH Key concept(authentication process), wha if my repo is public(any other user can esaily push?), what if my repo is private or i want to add collaborater in that(any 
   other user can  esaily push?)
5. learn more about branch
